# Apple Replica

- This site is a clone of Apple's original website back then when Apple first launched iPhone 11 Pro. I have coded only
  a small portion of the whole website. Watch live [here](https://apple-twin.netlify.app).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a markup language, used to create the basic structure of a site.

- **CSS3:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
  written in a markup language such as HTML.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part
  of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is
  an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

- **SCSS:** SCSS (Sassy Cascading Style Sheets) is a preprocessor which lets you use features that aren't a part of the
  wider CSS standard yet, and provides better workflows for maintaining your stylesheets.

- **Parcel JS:** Parcel is a web application bundler, differentiated by its developer experience. It offers blazing fast
  performance utilizing multicore processing, and requires zero configuration. Many front-end developers have become
  frustrated with some of the complexities involved with building web apps today.

- **NPM:** npm (Node Package Manager) is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them,
  and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases.
  Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.
